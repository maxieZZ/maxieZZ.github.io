### AN NLP Framework to Assess Prescription Stimulant Chatter on Reddit ~ December, 2023

As the only major controlled drug with increasing prescription rates in 2023, the rising popularity of stimulants like Adderall continues to prompt debates over appropriate usage and long-term effects. To understand this impact from the perspective of users, posts from "r/adderall", a subreddit dedicated to the discussion of ADHD drugs for recreational and medical use, were extracted. Specifically, 6,417 posts along with 13 associated features (including sentiment and user-derived tags) were analyzed. Ultimately, this framework helped to identify unmet needs of stimulant users, including a desire to learn more about holistic ADHD symptom management techniques rather than relying solely on pharmacological treatment.

### Feed-Forward Neural Networks in Gut Microbial Abundance Data for Disease Classification ~ May, 2024

As the leading cause of death and disability in the U.S, the continued rise of chronic conditions like cancer and irritable bowel syndrome (IBD) continues to prompt preventative efforts like early diagnosis and/or identification of prominent risk factors involved in disease progression. Since many of these diseases are partially characterized by modifications in composition and function of gut microbial species, understanding the link between our microbiome and disease onset may be helpful in informing early diagnosis and targeted treatment approaches. Due to the high dimensionality and complexity of data from the human gut microbiome, this investigation sought to determine the feasibility of deep learning approaches to predict disease states given microbial abundance data.

### An Investigation into the Security and Privacy of Bitcoin ~ March, 2020

In the past, online transactions have relied heavily on trusted third party systems. Recently however, a growing lack of trust in financial institutions has led to the creation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are decentralized and function without third parties. Launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has has established itself as a reputable method of exchange, posing the question of whether  blockchain technologies are a sustainable solution to the vulnerabilities existing within third party systems of currency. To address this question, I will analyze features in Bitcoin that promote security, privacy, and reliability, using basic coding examples in python test the extent to which they are adequate enough to function as an alternative method of digital currency. These features include proof of work, mining, consensus protocols, and networking infastructure.
