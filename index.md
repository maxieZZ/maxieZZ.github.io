### AN NLP Framework to Assess Prescription Stimulant Chatter on Reddit ~ 2024

As the only major controlled drug with increasing prescription rates in 2023, the rising popularity of stimulants like Adderall prompts debate over appropriate use and long-term effects. To better understand the impact from the perspective of users, 6,417 posts along with 13 associated features (including sentiment and user-derived tags) were extracted from the subreddit r/adderall and subsequently analyzed via BERTOPIC modeling.

### Feed-Forward Neural Networks in Gut Microbial Abundance Data for Disease Classification ~ 2024

As the leading cause of death and disability in the U.S, the rise of chronic conditions continues to prompt preventative efforts like early diagnosis and/or identification of prominent risk factors involved in disease progression. Since many diseases are characterized by modifications in composition of gut microbial species, understanding the link between our microbiome and disease onset may be helpful in informing early diagnosis and targeted treatment. Due to the high dimensionality and complexity of microbiome data, this investigation sought to determine the feasibility of deep learning approaches to predict disease states given microbial abundance data.

### An Investigation into the Security and Privacy of Bitcoin ~ 2020

In the past, online transactions have relied heavily on trusted third party systems. Recently however, a growing lack of trust in financial institutions has led to the creation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are decentralized and function without third parties. Launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has has established itself as a reputable method of exchange, posing the question of whether  blockchain technologies are a sustainable solution to the vulnerabilities existing within third party systems. To address this question, I tested Bitcoin features such as proof of work, mining, consensus protocols, and networking infastructure, using basic coding examples to analyze the extent to which they promote security, privacy, and reliability.
