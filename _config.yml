  Data Scientist / Junior Developer
  <br><br>
  An aspiring biomedical informatician with a passion for precision, functional, and lifestyle medicine. Though my background was originally in computer science, I’ve always been drawn to how technology can be creatively applied to fit a range of unmet needs, particularly within the healthcare domain. As a recent masters graduate from UT Houstons School of Biomedical Informatics, I am eager to apply myself to whatever challenge I am tasked with solving, learning from failures and successes alike.
